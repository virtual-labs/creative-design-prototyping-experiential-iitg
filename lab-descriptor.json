  "introduction": "The experiments under this laboratory belong to the discipline of Creative Design which concerns itself with a user centered product innovation. The experiments are in the specific area of Human Computer Interactions (HCI) - a specialization of interest to Computer Science, Electronics, Information Technology and Design students both at the Under graduate level as well as Postgraduate level. Experiments focus on understanding the theoretical basis of decision making while designing computer screens, displays and product interfaces. Usability parameters along with Visual Quality are the measures of differentiation between a good User Interface (GUI) and an inefficiently designed one. These experiments aim to make the students understand some of the underlying theory of designing user centric yet functional and logical interactions in products both hardware and software.",
